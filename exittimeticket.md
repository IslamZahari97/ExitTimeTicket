  
  Before taking this course, I focused more on the word ‘history’ rather than the word ‘crafting’ when I signed up for our 
crafting digital history class. As a communications and media studies student, history is an appealing elective for me because 
much of today’s mass media structures have rich historical contexts to them. I was surprised when I read the syllabus for the 
class about how technical the course is and less theoretical or historical. I was excited for the storytelling aspect that 
comes with a history course and I was expecting to learn about digital history such as the birth of social media, the birth 
of television, etc. But when I found out that the course revolves around experimenting with digital softwares,I was intimidated
until I read the reading about failing gloriously in week one. In honour of that reading, I am sharing my experience so others 
can learn from it because that is what failing gloriously means. I overestimated my technical abilities and my ability to 
self-teach. To be honest, I felt lost without personal guidance from normal lectures. For instance, having no recorded or 
live video lectures didn’t inspire me to be fully accountable with experimenting with suggested instructions each week. 
Even though there was a space to reach out for help, I feel like what was missing was pre-guidance and explanation of the 
purpose of the work that was tasked before starting the experimentation with it. For me, that guidance was crucial because 
the content was completely foreign, and hence intimidating to even start. Yes, failure was not discouraged but it’s hard to 
start something knowing that you will fail it, and that’s how I felt about week two to week five. However, as a digital 
historian I managed to personalize the content to develop in this field and I argue that the things that I learned from this 
course are worthy of a passing grade.

  First, argumentation! I mastered that learning outcome because I learned how to argue for the people who deserve credit for 
their digital archiving. I learned that there are many people behind the scenes that are not acknowledged, people whose work 
is crucial to the documentation of history. From week one, when I downloaded Zotero and set it up I was amazed at the 
affordence the software gave me to digitize my own personal library,essentially a digital archive of everything that I’ve read.
From week six, I learned about the colonial effect of digital history and how understanding history means understanding who 
decides what is knowledge and non-knowledge. By studying the importance of actors and their perspectives, not just the 
perspectives of the main characters or the elite actors of a historical event, I was empowered to know that my perspective of 
my journey matters. Through teaching me how to archive my own history using softwares such as Github, Hypothesis and Zotero, 
this course has empowered me to look beyond the website. I now understand that behind every static website or encyclopedia 
page there lies a lot of hard work, a lot of coding and a lot of people who are left out from the story. Therefore, I believe 
I am a better digital historian from an argumentative perspective now, compared to when I started crafting digital history.

 Second, personalization! I am good at reading and writing which is basically what I learn about in communications, so I didn’t 
let my limited technical abilities hinder me from advancing in the course. For example, I did what I could to engage in each 
week’s material despite my lack of digital skills. I read each reading and reflected on them and tried to understand the 
significance of the softwares I was reading about even though I didn't know how to use them. I understand how these softwares 
make digital historian’s lives much easier and how they advance the human necessity to archive our stories for future 
generations to learn from. I also understand and appreciate the digital historians who use the softwares because it not only 
requires a certain level of skill, but serious dedication to navigate their intricate features. In addition, dedicating long 
hours of data entry to achieve the desired archiving result, which is something that should not be taken for granted. I also 
read every Discord page to see what I could learn from my peers’ experiences with the weekly tasks and I personalized that by 
appreciating how my journey is unique to them even though we have decided to take the same path of crafting digital history.

  Admittingly, I lacked analytical ability, methodology and collaboration, but I believe that mastering the argumentation and 
personalization aspects of the learning outcomes of the course is proof that I am able to craft digital history. I wish I could
have taken this course in class somehow to receive mentorship and face-to-face collaboration that I desperately needed. I also 
wish that I took this course at a less sensitive time, considering the major events that were happening in the world over the
past two months. Nevertheless, I am grateful for my experience during the six weeks of online self-learning and I will apply 
what I learned to make my life easier, especially when doing future research. I have never felt discriminated against or 
isolated despite my lacking technical abilities. This is mainly thanks to the multiple resources provided by the professor. 
Especially his encouragement of reflecting on the material and for that I am thankful because it enhanced my crafting digital 
history experience. Thank you for the life lessons, I’ll be sure to archive them.
